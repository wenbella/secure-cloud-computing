# secure-cloud-computing

This project aims to include the states-of-the-art reserach works in secure cloud computing. The topic involves in access pattern protection and secure data query under the outsourcing scenario. It also contains some typical cryptographic primitive designs and their applications (e.g., PIR, oblivious RAM, oblivious shuffling, inner production encryption, and blockchains) in the real world.
